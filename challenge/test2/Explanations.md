1. For the API part I used the Gin framework that I'm used to working with.

2. I've decided to store datas on a JSON file, I could do it on a database but I think that the JSON file should be enough

3. For the Docker part I've created a container that contains the Go project and launch the server listening at start.

4. Most of features I used are commented directly in the code and don't hesitate if you have questions about them. `:)`
